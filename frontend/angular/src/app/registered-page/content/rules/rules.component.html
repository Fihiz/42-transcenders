        <h4>What is Pong</h4>
        <p>
          Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created, this simple
          "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to
          defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain10 point, a player
          gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.

      <h3>Chat Rules</h3>
      <div class="block">
        <h4>Be kind</h4>
        <p>
          Giving constructive feedback is good. Being unnecessarily mean isnâ€™t
          what we do here. Make sure you take the time to evaluate which you are
          doing before you send a message.
        </p>
        <h4>Respect other humans</h4>
        <p>
          We know our pong players are fine specimens of humanity. Complimenting
          them is good. Sexually objectifying, creeping on, describing violent
          actions toward, describing your physical reactions to, or otherwise
          dehumanizing them is not.
        </p>
        <h4>Include everyone</h4>
        <p>
          We want this chat to be a safe and welcoming place for everyone. Don't
          do anything that might make someone feel like they don't belong. This
          includes but is not limited to generalizations of types of people,
          hate speech, or discriminatory language based on gender, religion,
          ethnicity, sex or socioeconomic background.
